msgstr ""

msgid "Restrict CiviCRM UI elements to main site only."
msgstr ""

msgid "When CiviCRM is network-activated in WordPress Multisite, it will load on every sub-site. This may not be what you want - especially when Multisite uses subdirectories - because CiviCRM makes assumptions about the path to WordPress admin and as a result there are a number of problems with CiviCRM. So check this option to restrict the appearance of the CiviCRM UI elements (as well as access to the CiviCRM Admin Utilities settings page) to the main site only."

msgid "Settings Page access"

msgid "Restrict access to CiviCRM Admin Utilities Settings Pages to Network Admins only."
msgstr ""

msgid "When CiviCRM is activated on one or more individual sites in WordPress Multisite, you may want to restrict who has access to the CiviCRM Admin Utilities Settings Page on each site. This is useful if the individual site administrators on your network should be prevented from changing the settings that Network Admins define for the sites where CiviCRM is activated."

msgid "Restrict access to CiviCRM Admin Utilities Domain Pages to Network Admins only."
msgstr ""

msgid "When CiviCRM is activated on one or more individual sites in WordPress Multisite and you are allowing access to Settings Pages, it is likely that you want to restrict access to the CiviCRM Admin Utilities Domain Page on each site to Network Admins only. If, for some reason, you want to allow the individual site administrators on your network to access the CiviCRM domain settings, uncheck this setting."

msgid "When CiviCRM is activated on on one or more individual sites in WordPress Multisite, you may want to restrict who has the \"Administer CiviCRM\" capability to Network Admins only. This is useful if the individual site administrators on your network should be prevented from having \"root access\" to CiviCRM. You will need CiviCRM 4.7.19+ for this to have an effect."

msgstr ""

msgid "Fix the Contact \"soft delete\" process."
msgstr ""

msgid "When a CiviCRM Contact is initially deleted, CiviCRM does not actually delete the Contact record, but instead flags it as deleted so that it can be \"undeleted\" if necessary. However, this \"soft delete\" process deletes the data linking the Contact to the WordPress User (the UFMatch record) and this is lost when the Contact is \"Restored from Trash\". Checking this option retains this data until the Contact is \"hard deleted\". Leave unchecked to retain existing behaviour."
